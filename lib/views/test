While I'm not totally sure, and correct me if I'm wrong, you aren't happy with my lack of support of some ideas brought up recently.

I agree organisation is important, and I appreciate everyone's efforts to improve the scheme for next year, however I do think there are issues we learnt from last year.

One of these *was* mentor engagement. As nice of an idea as it is to involve everyone, and get everyone's opinions on any ideas that arise, it's incredibly impractical to actually receive all that feedback and act on it in a way that makes everyone happy, particularly because of the kind of people we are working with in the scheme.  By nature, most people will not take it seriously, will derail conversations, and generally get in the way.

Our approach to this last year, was that we took on the majority of the tasks as a Senior Mentor team. Obviously we went overboard in this regard, everyone has made their opinion clear on that. However, there is some benefit to that approach, in that at least that group of people are going to be more experienced, more willing to take things seriously, and comes with the benefit of fewer people to manage. That isn't to say Mentor input isn't valuable, but introducing an idea to a large group of people is bound to bring some problems.

While I appreciate all of your efforts to improve collaboration in the scheme, I feel there are a few key issues. It's worth noting that you are more than welcome to do as you wish, as a team. My role is purely advisory, and I will help out in any way that is needed.

I understand that everyone is eager to make plans at this stage, however, being the middle of summer, many people will not be able to contribute to the scheme. People will not make it to meetings, be checking discord, and be very unreliable. Personally, I think this is a good time to be brainstorming and making rough plans as a Senior Mentor team or in even smaller subgroups, however the involvement of 50ish mentors, I feel, is too much and will hurt more than help the planning process.  I know you all have big plans, but I do feel that beginning the planning process with *everyone* a month early is overkill. While big plans for Welcome Week might be a good idea, getting rough ideas from Mentors is personally the extent to which I'd go, and then hammer out the details as a smaller SM team.

When making plans, generally I feel it best to have a clear understanding of an event/idea before bringing it to the mentors. You guys last year regularly picked apart our plans, and I genuinely feel that if we had taken them to you at an earlier stage, then nothing would have ended up happening. Again, that is not to say your ideas won't work, I just feel it's best to ensure ideas are fleshed out first. It is your guys' role to ensure that things to get out of hand with too much going on, which is where I feel it would end up with everyone involved to early on.

To give an example for these two points, while the GitLab issues system for tracking is a good idea (personally I feel something more like Trello would be clearer for this, but it's essentially the same thing). My issue really stemmed from it being made by Dom, and while he is already proving himself as a valuable mentor, I think something like this would work better for tracking issues within the Senior Mentor team, and then announcements, or other documents, can be released to the mentors when ready.

I know a key aim is to make mentors more involved in the process, and before our year this was in the form of Mentors running sessions, while Senior Mentors planned them. With this strategy, there is a clearer separation of roles between SM and Mentors, and the experience gained as a Mentor helps guide the decision-making process as a SM. Comparatively, you guys have more experience than the Mentors, so I feel you guys on your own can do a fantastic job of event planning, and as stated, it very much becomes a "Too many cooks..." situation, particularly when the other "cooks" are mentors, who, as we have seen, are very excitable, and can often create additional stress, confusion, and generally slow processes down.

I hope that's all clear, but generally speaking, it's more the way that some decisions have been made that I have an issue with - which isn't to say they are a bad idea at all. My role is completely advisory, and I can understand that you guys are trying to do something different.  My lack of enthusiasm or support (and I admit, in some cases, my negativity) towards your ideas is clearly causing issues, so I want it to be clear that you guys are very much in control and have my full support. I hope that addresses your key points, let me know if there's anything you feel I missed, or anything you'd like to elaborate on.
